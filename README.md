### Advanced Data Encryption
Security is a top priority at Go_Chat. I implemented a custom data encryption algorithm to ensure the privacy of our users` communications. The encryption algorithm is based on Huffman Encoding, which I personally developed and integrated into the application. This algorithm encrypts messages before they are stored on our servers, providing robust protection against unauthorized access.
